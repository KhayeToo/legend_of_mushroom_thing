## Overview

This project aims to create a useful Discord bot for the game [Legend of Mushroom](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxdzzus.google&hl=en_US&gl=US)
The purpose of the Discord bot is to give the user information on equipment stats.

There are also plans to create a public API to serve this information.

Currently the code is in a non-working / experimental state.
